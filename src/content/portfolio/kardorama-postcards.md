Kardorama has been operating in London for decades, selling bulk postcards to newsagents and souvenir shops across the capital. The industry is very competitive with a lot of different market factors.

I was contracted to provide a number of designs, over 20 of which were printed and distributed to shops all over London, and from there were mailed or carried across the world.

As well as adding text and minimal graphics to some cards, I also did editing in Photoshop, colour correction and devised entirely new layouts in order to re-use their vast library of stock imagery.
