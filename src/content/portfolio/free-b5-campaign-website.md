Babylon 5 is a controversial show loved by millions worldwide. But it suffered from a lot of studio politics and changing economic climate.

At the behest of the show's creator JM Straczynski the fans organised a campaign to raise publicity that would hopefully lead to a reboot, reimagining or continuation of the story that was first broadcast in 1995.

The domain was purchased by a prominent campaigner, and I volunteered to provide my services to design, build and host the site.

The campaigner and I talked about the design and content, which went through a few iterations before we settled on the final result.

Over the duration of the campaign I reworked the design in response to changing design trends and how the campaign transformed.

The initial build was a WordPress website, which I quickly replaced with a custom PHP backend. Then I moved to a flat file format which was easier to manage and free to host.
