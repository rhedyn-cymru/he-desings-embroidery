## The Challenge

Zopa needed someone to liaise and help develop their new website, replatforming from Ruby on Rails to a static site using some very experimental JavaScript technology (GatsbyJS).

## The Approach

Together with members of the design team and senior marketing professionals, myself and two colleagues produced pages as they went through the approval process.

Once the initial build was launched the product continued through design iteration cycles. New features continued to be built, including integration with a blogging platform, retrieving and displaying TrustPilot reviews via an API, and analytics and A/B testing technology among others.

## The Outcome

Zopa continues its success although it has since replatformed from this solution. The designs shown are for the final iteration of the project during my tenure.
