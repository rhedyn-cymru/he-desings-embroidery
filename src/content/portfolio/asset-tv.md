## The Challenge

Asset.tv are a leading platform providing educational content for investment professionals. Their websites display promoted videos from various high profile investment companies. The sites were beginning to look stale and the company was replatforming to Drupal 9 from Drupal 7 which was a major technical challenge.

Further complications included supporting different brands. As well as Asset TV, the company has a separate brand called Insure TV. This meant the primary colours had to be abstracted so the branding could be changed based on where the theme was being used. 

## The Approach

I worked with the designer to refine the designs they were working on, then later developed a standalone demo in HTML and CSS. This allowed us to refine the components and layout and work out compromises where the design and the technology were at variance.

We then went through a few iterations and feedback cycles with higher management. After that myself and 2 others implemented the code changes on the CMS.

Sometimes this required a lot of templating logic. We used Twig as a templating system and Tailwind for the CSS, which is quite a straightforward stack, but on some pages (channel pages in particular) there could be up to 4 variations on the header and navigation area. These included a logged in and logged out state, a dark and light design, and 3 different channel styles. 

## The Outcome

The rebrand was successfully launched in 2024. The company are working on another design refresh that is currently in progress. The screenshot above shows the last design iteration before my tenure ended.
