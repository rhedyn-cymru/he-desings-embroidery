## The Challenge

DJM Healthcare operate two clinics in Ware and Potters Bar. They're a husband and wife team who do their jobs very well indeed. However there was a lack of cohesion between the two clinics. Often customers would not realise that there were in fact 2 clinics they could choose from.

The exercise included a full rebrand that would include flyers, stationery and a new website that would inform customers of the locations, services and pricing for both clinics.

## The Approach

I came up with this playful logo that immediately shows the care and concern that these dedicated individuals put into their business.

There was also a flyer design that would be displayed in both clinics so that visitors could also clearly identify the relationship between the clinics.

Although their website has changed now it was well received and helped boost their identity and business awareness in the community.
