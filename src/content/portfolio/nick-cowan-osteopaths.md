## The Challenge

Nick operated out of three different London locations which was great for business but presented challenges for his brand. He needed a strong, reassuring identity which would help customers see him and his services as distinct from the clinics where he operated.

## The Approach

I came up with a whimsical logo that Nick loved instantly. The running man was drawn directly into an electronic artwork tool using a pen tablet. We iterated over the design but Nick kept coming back to the first design and decided to stick with it.

I also supplied Nick with a template he could use as a background to invoices and letters he sent to his customers.

Although Nick's website has changed since I built it, the logo remains a clear indicator of the trust he has in our branding.
