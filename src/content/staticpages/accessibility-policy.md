Technical information about this website’s accessibility

Rhedyn is committed to making its website accessible. This website is partially compliant with the Web content accessibility guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due to certain non-compliances and exemptions.

## Non-accessible content

The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.

A few of our PDFs and other document types may not be suitable for users of assistive technology.

Where documents are not in an accessible format, you can request it by emailing hello@rhedyn.cymru.

Some of our older PDFs and Microsoft Office documents may not meet accessibility standards. For example, they may not be marked up so they are accessible to a screen reader.

Where possible, any new PDFs or Microsoft Office documents we publish will meet accessibility standards. Where this is not possible, we will endeavour to make the information available in an accessible format.  If you need documents in a different format like accessible PDF, large print please email: hello@rhedyn.cymru.

## What we’re doing to improve accessibility

As we continue to develop the website and its content, we will re-audit and test the website for accessibility on a regular basis.
